# UKCoreFSH

This project is intended to serve a number of purposes

- be a repository of FSH examples to demonstrate how to use FSH to generate FHIR assets

- explore the ease/convenience of FSH as an authoring tool for FHIR

- provide a means to explore how deltas between versions of FHIR assets become easier to obtain

- provide a means to easily see (and validate) that the content of FHIR assets is as intended

- understand what constraints have been aplied to FHIR profiles

# Alignment to UK Core

This project is not related to the delivery of the UK Core assets in any way. UK Core was chosen as it is a set of FHIR assets that are visisble to most within the UK.

This project concerns itself with the use of FHIR Shorthand. If there are issues/questions with the UK Core assets themselves, then these should be addressed to the UK Core team directly.

The content of this repository makes no claims in being in sync with the assets published by UK Core. The delivery process of UK Core is not clear, there is currently no public road map or robust release mechanism.

# Roadmap

Delivery will be split into small releases, feel free to contribute.

The scope of the first itteration will be published shortly - feel free to raise quetions/issues/bugs etc here on GitHub.
